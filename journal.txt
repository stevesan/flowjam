TASK LIST:

notes on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyme#Types_of_rhyme

    ALLOWED:
    perfect rhymes, all genders. rhyme/sublime, sight/flight, madness/sadness
        perfect rhymes match the end vowel and all other remaining sounds. too strict, but should be a subset of our rhymes.

    syllabic: last syllables rhyme, but are not stressed. pitter/patter - low scores
    imperfect: rhymed syllable are mixed stressed/not stressed. wing/caring - low scores
        the CMU DB doesn't contain stress info, so we can't distinguish between syllabic/imperfect/perfect rhymes.
    allow some forced rhymes..
        forced: one/thumb, green/fiend
        actually, these match vowels, not sure how these are diff from slant rhymes
    assonance/slant rhymes: matching vowels only. ALLOW THESE!! shake/hate

    NOT ALLOWED:
    consonance: rabies/robbers
    half rhyme: bent/ant - eh..don't allow these
    semi rhymes: like bend/ending. but do allow bending/ending
    pararhyme: tell/tall
    alliteration: short ship..nope. maybe another game heh

    SCORING DESIGN:

    matching consonants alone do not count, ie. love/move
    but if syllables rhyme, then matching consonants give bonus points. shake/hate < shake/bake

    what phonemes constitute a vowel?
    bottle/ration clearly don't rhyme at all, but they end in the same AH vowel..so sometimes vowels must be combined
        with the last consonant..
    maybe we need to parse syllables from the phonemes, and score per-syllable?
        AH N does not match AH L (ration/bottle)
        but, EY K does match EY T (shake/hate)

    hmm seems like certain cons-phonemes MODIFY proceeding vowel-phonemes..
        L, N, NG, R

- need to read/think about about syllables vs. phonemes..
    syllables, much more intuitive
        can give feedback like, "3 syllables rhymed! AWESOME!"
    broccoli/monopoly should score higher than fashion/ration.
    And hollow/bottle should score low, but non-zero

    phonemes are not the most accurate either, since still/real should be a 0-rhyme. But they do end on the L phoneme.

    0 means no rhyme at all. 
- 0 means no rhyme at all. 1 is easy rhyme. 0<x<1 is barely "meh" rhyme

- allow multiple words? I scream/ice cream, and sort of for "eyes cream"
    this would work for that case!

LOW PRIORITY:

- "lame rhymes"
    this paragraph on wikipedia:
    "As stated above, in a perfect rhyme the last stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical in both words. If the sound preceding the stressed vowel is also identical, the rhyme is sometimes considered to be inferior and not a perfect rhyme after all.[2][3] An example of such a "super-rhyme" or "more than perfect rhyme" is the "identical rhyme", in which not only the vowels but also the onsets of the rhyming syllables are identical, as in gun and begun. Punning rhymes such are "bare" and "bear" are also identical rhymes. The rhyme may of course extend even farther back than the last stressed vowel. If it extends all the way to the beginning of the line, so that there are two lines that sound identical, then it is called a "holorhyme" ("For I scream/For ice cream")."
    obviously we need to filter out when the user just types in the word...
    but cases like gun/begun should be punished a bit? make this low priority
    punning rhymes, like bare/bear are similar cases...
    we could say, if either word's phonemes are a perfect subset of the others, then disallow the rhyme
        we could make this an option... ie. disallow "lame rhymes" like these

DONE TASKS:

- settled on CMU database. Moby database is missing plurals ("hands"), has bunch of pointless phrases (like "bad actor"..wtf?), and has weird phoneme format
- partial score for close-consonants, like S vs. Z, T vs. D
- Difference pronunciations for same spelling, ie. “I’m so close” vs. “Close the door”
	CMU lists variants, with close(2) etc. Just check all of them
