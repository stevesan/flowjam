TASK LIST:

- 1v1 mode: first one to get 100 points wins, but you both choose from the same pool of words. once someone rhymes a word at all, it is removed from the "pool".
    want to recreate the feeling of the card game Speed
    FOCUS ON THIS
    center column of prompt words, one word per row
    left/right columns are p1/p2 typing space
    switch rows by pressing number key, type and enter to submit
    when one player submits a rhyming word, they get the point and the word changes on that row
    first one to 50 points wins

- need to reverse pitch direction of sounds. better --> higher pitch
- give sounds AS feedback is given? ie. whenever score goes up, play a sound?
    need huge fx for high bonus levels

- endless mode:
    points per minute
    graph of points over time?

- what's my goal? to make you think of rhymes, preferably with more syllables.
    should be easy to play with

- multiple words
    I scream/ice cream
    orange/four hinge

- think:
    definitely need:
        timed mode
        turn-based

    Sequence-like battle mode?

    PvP mode? see who gets the most number of points for a single word in 1 minute?
    
    PvP - each person picks 10 words, other person tries to get as many points for any of those words

- need to see what kind of words are in the Moby list but not in CMU

- bonus for 2 greats in a row?
    well..sometimes you only get single-syllabe words though.
    DO NOT PROMPT SINGLE-SYLLABLE WORDS?

- compute difficulty of words by mining the database for total score?
- frequency: would be good to avoid super obscure words
    mine wikipedia?

- alliteration bonus!
- allow user to stay on the same word? coming up with multiple rhymes could be fun..
    text twist style..
    well, this would complicate the interface/flow
- list of words at end of round.

- design idea: use the climber setup, but you need to fill a bar to take a step.
    more rhyme score == more bar.
    so, no numbers, just purely visual feedback
    you can skip words, but you sacrifice some time (may be 0.5s)

LOW PRIORITY:

- could still use the 'scorePhonemes' function to score coda matches. Like, give D/T 0.25...meh.

- "lame rhymes"
    this paragraph on wikipedia:
    "As stated above, in a perfect rhyme the last stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical in both words. If the sound preceding the stressed vowel is also identical, the rhyme is sometimes considered to be inferior and not a perfect rhyme after all.[2][3] An example of such a "super-rhyme" or "more than perfect rhyme" is the "identical rhyme", in which not only the vowels but also the onsets of the rhyming syllables are identical, as in gun and begun. Punning rhymes such are "bare" and "bear" are also identical rhymes. The rhyme may of course extend even farther back than the last stressed vowel. If it extends all the way to the beginning of the line, so that there are two lines that sound identical, then it is called a "holorhyme" ("For I scream/For ice cream")."
    obviously we need to filter out when the user just types in the word...
    but cases like gun/begun should be punished a bit? make this low priority
    punning rhymes, like bare/bear are similar cases...
    we could say, if either word's phonemes are a perfect subset of the others, then disallow the rhyme
        we could make this an option... ie. disallow "lame rhymes" like these

- we can read more about syllabification:

DONE TASKS:

- settled on CMU database. Moby database is missing plurals ("hands"), has bunch of pointless phrases (like "bad actor"..wtf?), and has weird phoneme format
- partial score for close-consonants, like S vs. Z, T vs. D
- Difference pronunciations for same spelling, ie. “I’m so close” vs. “Close the door”
	CMU lists variants, with close(2) etc. Just check all of them

notes on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyme#Types_of_rhyme

    ALLOWED:
    perfect rhymes, all genders. rhyme/sublime, sight/flight, madness/sadness
        perfect rhymes match the end vowel and all other remaining sounds. too strict, but should be a subset of our rhymes.

    syllabic: last syllables rhyme, but are not stressed. pitter/patter - low scores
    imperfect: rhymed syllable are mixed stressed/not stressed. wing/caring - low scores
        the CMU DB doesn't contain stress info, so we can't distinguish between syllabic/imperfect/perfect rhymes.
    allow some forced rhymes..
        forced: one/thumb, green/fiend
        actually, these match vowels, not sure how these are diff from slant rhymes
    assonance/slant rhymes: matching vowels only. ALLOW THESE!! shake/hate

    NOT ALLOWED:
    consonance: rabies/robbers
    half rhyme: bent/ant - eh..don't allow these
    semi rhymes: like bend/ending. but do allow bending/ending
    pararhyme: tell/tall
    alliteration: short ship..nope. maybe another game heh

    SCORING DESIGN:

    matching consonants alone do not count, ie. love/move
    but if syllables rhyme, then matching consonants give bonus points. shake/hate < shake/bake

    what phonemes constitute a vowel?
    bottle/ration clearly don't rhyme at all, but they end in the same AH vowel..so sometimes vowels must be combined
        with the last consonant..
    maybe we need to parse syllables from the phonemes, and score per-syllable?
        AH N does not match AH L (ration/bottle)
        but, EY K does match EY T (shake/hate)

    hmm seems like certain cons-phonemes MODIFY proceeding vowel-phonemes..
        L, N, NG, R

    OK I'm pretty happy with what I have right now. 

    lowest score for any rhyme at all is 1.0. We can't have 0.5

- need to read/think about about syllables vs. phonemes..
    syllables, much more intuitive
        can give feedback like, "3 syllables rhymed! AWESOME!"
    broccoli/monopoly should score higher than fashion/ration.
    And hollow/bottle should score low, but non-zero <-- eh forget this. it's not a very convincing rhyme.

    phonemes are not the most accurate either, since still/real should be a 0-rhyme. But they do end on the L phoneme.

- refactored code to use proper linguistics names (turns out i rediscovered syllabic consonants, and had the same listed as the most common ones)
    I no longer give 0.5 for matcing syllabic consonants, except for M, and this feels better
- combos
- friendliness vs. emptiness consider allowing AH S == IH S
    abortionist vs. pessimist
- think about combo system...too powerful?
    yes, ditching it
- filter out really obscure words: get some source of words and mine it.
    done using Moby word list
- debug assert for 'p'
- debug assert for c, co, cor, corn
    fixed, there was a slight bug in the code i fixed at some pt
- debug: obsessions/recessions - adding S should not bump your score up by 4...
    OK redid the bonus system - no longer assuming floor gives me number of syllables..heh
- player feedback:
    0.0 = FAIL
    1.0 = OK
    1.5 = Good
    2.0 = Good
    2.5 = Great
    3.0 = Great
    3.5+ = EXCELLENT!
    in the game, but slightly different
- use stars to rate rhymes? better than word feedback
    eh..no, stars + points would get confusing.. but better VISUAL feedback wouldn't hurt, just don't tie it to some quantity
- prevent lame rhymes and just repeating the word
    done, just checking substrings
